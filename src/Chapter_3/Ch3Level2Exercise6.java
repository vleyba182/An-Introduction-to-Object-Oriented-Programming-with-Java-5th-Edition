 * Modify the Ch3FindDayOfWeek program by accepting the date
 * information as a single string instead of accepting the year,
 * month, and day information separately. The input string must
 * be in the MM/dd/yyyy format. For example, July 4, 1776, is
 * entered as 07/04/1776. There will be exactly two digits
 * for the month and day and four digits for the year.
