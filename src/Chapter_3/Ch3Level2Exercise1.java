/**
 * Created by vicenteleyba on 7/7/16.
 *
 * The velocity of a satellite circling around theEarth is
 * computed by the formula v = sqrt(GMe / r)
 *
 * where Me = 5.98 * 10^24 kg is the mass of the Earth, r
 * the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite in meters,
 * and G = 6.67 * 10^11 m^3/kg * s^2 the universal gravitational constant.
 * The unit of the velocity v is m/s. Write a program that inputs the radius r
 * and outputs the satelliteâ€™s velocity. Confirm that a satellite that is closer to
 * the Earth travels faster. Define symbolic constants for ME and G. The distance to
 * the Hubble Space Telescope from the center of the Earth, for example, is
 * approximately 6.98 * 10^6 m.
