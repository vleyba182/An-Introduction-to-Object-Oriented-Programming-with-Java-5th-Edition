 *
 * When you say you are 18 years old,you are really
 * saying that the Earth has circled the Sun 18 times.
 * Since other planets take fewer or more days than Earth to
 * travel around the Sun, your age would be different on other
 * planets. You can compute how old you are on other planets by the
 * formula y = (x * 365) / d where x is the age on Earth, y is the
 * age on planet Y,and d is the number of Earth days the planet Y
 * takes to travel around the Sun. Write an application that
 * inputs the userâ€™s Earth age and print outs his or her age
 * on Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. The values
 * for d are listed in the table.
 *
 * Planet           Approximate Number of Earth Days for This
 *                  Planet to Travel around the Sun
 * Mercury          88
 * Venus            225
 * Jupiter          4,380
 * Saturn           10,767
